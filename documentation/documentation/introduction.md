# Introduction

## What is Korpi?

Korpi is a voxel game engine written in C# and OpenGL, that will eventually develop into it's own game. It is currently in early development, and I'm working on the engine to make it more stable and feature complete.

All contributions are welcome, and I'm happy to help anyone who wants to contribute! If you want to contribute, please read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/japsuu/Korpi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
